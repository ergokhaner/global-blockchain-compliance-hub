The treatment of virtual currencies differs among States; they have been considered, amongst others, an equivalent to legal tender, a separate asset class, a payment method, a commodity and a unique technological platform. At the time of writing, cryptocurrencies are unregulated under Maltese law and exchanges of cryptocurrencies (for other cryptocurrencies or for fiat currency) are deemed equivalent to commodity trading. A company utilising virtual currencies is currently not required to obtain a licence from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) unless it qualifies as a collective investment scheme or carries on the business of a financial institution or payment service provider, in which case the company would need to be appropriately licensed in terms of the Financial Institutions Act. Moreover, digital coins are not considered as being investment instruments under the Investment Services Act at present, and so investment activities related to cryptocurrencies would not trigger any licensing requirements in terms of this act. It is worth noting that the MFSA has recently issued a [consultation document](http://www.mamotcv.com/resources/news/the-malta-financial-services-authority-launches-a-consultation-documentaimed-at-regulating-collective-investment-schemes-investing-in-virtual-currencies) in relation to the proposed regulation of the investment in cryptocurrencies by specific legal entities.

With respect to legal perspectives, investors should be wary of potential pitfalls such as fraudulent crowdfunding schemes or ICOs and securities fraud. The fact that transactions involving cryptocurrencies cannot be reversed once executed (at least at this stage) coupled with the anonymity enjoyed by parties to such dealings regrettably present attractive opportunities for illegal activity. Another issue which may further complicate matters in relation to cross-border cryptocurrency transactions would be the potentially different classification and regulatory requirements to which such transactions may be subject.
